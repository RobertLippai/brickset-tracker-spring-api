# BrickSet Tracker - Spring Boot API

[![Fly Deploy](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-api/actions/workflows/fly-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-api/actions/workflows/fly-deploy.yml)


This project serves as the backend for the new **[Brickset Tracker - Vue Frontend](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-frontend)**, and is a re-implementation of the logic from my original [Flask application](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset_tracker).

The API is secured using JWT-based authentication and authorization. All endpoints, except for registration and login, require a valid JWT token for access.

## Live API Endpoint

The API is deployed on Fly.io and is live. You can interact with the public endpoints using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl`.

*   **Base URL:** `https://brickset-tracker-spring-api.fly.dev/api/sets`
*   **API Base Path:** `/api`

**Example:** To get all sets, you can make a `GET` request to `https://brickset-tracker-spring-api.fly.dev/api/sets`.

## Tech
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- H2 Database (In-Memory)
- JJWT (JSON Web Token Library)
- Containerized with Docker & deployed on Fly.io 

## Current Features
- Full CRUD operations for brick sets and brands.
- A RESTful API architecture.

## Configuration
To run the application, you must set the following environment variables:

| Variable Name    | Description                                                                                             | Example Value                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | A long, random, Base64-encoded string for signing JWTs. You can generate one [here](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/hmac-sha256-online). | `your-super-long-and-secure-base64-secret-key` |
| `DB_PASSWORD`    | The password for the H2 in-memory database. The default username is `sa`.                                 | `password`                                   |
    
## How to Run Locally
**Prerequisites:**
- JDK 17 or later
- Apache Maven

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-spring-api.git
cd brickset-tracker-spring-api
```

**Run the application using Maven:**

mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Roadmap
**The following features are planned to bring it closer to the original Flask application and beyond:**
- [X] **Implement security using Spring Security and JWT.**
- [X] **Implement Role-Based Authorization**
  -   Secure `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints for sets, brands, and tags so they are only accessible to users with an `EDITOR` or `ADMIN` role. 
- [X] **CI/CD Integration:** Set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push to main.
- [ ] **Migrate to a Persistent Database**
  - Migrate from the in-memory database to a persistent one, like PostgreSQL.
- [ ] **Advanced Querying**
  - Add more complex query endpoints (searching, filtering, etc.).
-   [ ] **Build a Standalone Frontend**
